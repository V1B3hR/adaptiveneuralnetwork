## What is Adaptive Neural Network?

**Adaptive Neural Network** is a production‚Äëready, biologically‚Äëinspired framework for neural networks that go beyond conventional architectures. It focuses on dynamic internal state evolution, phase transitions, and energy modulation‚Äîenabling neural behaviors such as selective activation, sleep/active cycles, adaptive node regulation, and real-time robustness. The framework is designed for research and real-world deployments, supporting PyTorch, JAX, and neuromorphic backends.

Key features:
- **Vectorized phase-driven dynamics** (active, sleep, interactive, inspired)
- **Energy & sparsity‚Äìaware node regulation**
- **Multi-backend support** (PyTorch, JAX, neuromorphic abstraction)
- **Robustness, adversarial & multimodal benchmarks**
- **HR Analytics integration for employee attrition prediction**
- **Structured validation guides for intelligence, robustness, spatial reasoning, and production signal processing**

> **Why "Adaptive"?**  
> The framework introduces dynamic phase transitions, energy modulation, and proactive interventions inspired by biological neural systems. Unlike conventional static feed-forward networks, adaptive neural networks can self-modulate, respond to stressors, and demonstrate emergent behaviors in complex environments.

## üìä HR Analytics Integration

The framework supports IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset analysis and prediction.

**Steps:**
1. Download dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
2. Place CSV file at `data/WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`
3. Or use synthetic data (auto-generated if real dataset is absent)

**Run training:**
```bash
python runsimulation.py
EPOCHS=50 BATCH_SIZE=128 python runsimulation.py
python runsimulation.py 42   # Reproducible seed
```

Artifacts in `outputs/`:  
- `hr_training_results.json`  
- `dataset_info.json`  
- `hr_model_weights.json`  

Integrated into CI/CD with automated dataset caching, configurable parameters, and Python 3.12 compatibility.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration System

Centralized configuration for reproducible experiments and runtime parameter control:

**Quick Example:**
```python
from adaptiveneuralnetwork.config import AdaptiveNeuralNetworkConfig
config = AdaptiveNeuralNetworkConfig()
config.proactive_interventions.anxiety_threshold = 6.0
config.attack_resilience.energy_drain_resistance = 0.9
```

Supports JSON/YAML files, environment variables, and runtime overrides.
