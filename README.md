## What is Adaptive Neural Network?

**Adaptive Neural Network** is a production‑ready, biologically‑inspired framework for neural networks that go beyond conventional architectures. It focuses on dynamic internal state evolution, phase transitions, and energy modulation—enabling neural behaviors such as selective activation, sleep/active cycles, adaptive node regulation, and real-time robustness. The framework is designed for research and real-world deployments, supporting PyTorch, JAX, and neuromorphic backends.

Key features:
- **Vectorized phase-driven dynamics** (active, sleep, interactive, inspired)
- **Energy & sparsity–aware node regulation**
- **Multi-backend support** (PyTorch, JAX, neuromorphic abstraction)
- **Robustness, adversarial & multimodal benchmarks**
- **HR Analytics integration for employee attrition prediction**
- **Structured validation guides for intelligence, robustness, spatial reasoning, and production signal processing**

> **Why "Adaptive"?**  
> The framework introduces dynamic phase transitions, energy modulation, and proactive interventions inspired by biological neural systems. Unlike conventional static feed-forward networks, adaptive neural networks can self-modulate, respond to stressors, and demonstrate emergent behaviors in complex environments.
