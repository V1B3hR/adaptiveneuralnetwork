# adaptiveneuralnetwork
a biologically-inspired network of nodes (“AliveLoopNode”) interacting with capacitors and external data streams, featuring: - Staged sleep (light, REM, deep) - Mixed phases (active, inspired, interactive) - Anxiety and restorative behaviour
# Adaptive Network

This project implements an adaptive neural network inspired by brain states, integrating staged sleep, mixed phases, anxiety management, memory replay/sharing, and external signal adaptation.

## Structure

- `core/`: Main model classes (`alive_node.py`, `capacitor.py`, `network.py`)
- `experiments/`: Testing and demonstration scripts (`demo_test.py`)
- `run_simulation.py`: Entry point for running the demo
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions

## Getting Started

1. Install requirements (`numpy`).
2. Run the demo simulation:
   ```
   python run_simulation.py
   ```

## Features

- Staged sleep (light, REM, deep)
- Mixed/overlapping phases (active, inspired, interactive)
- Anxiety tracking and relief
- Memory replay and sharing during sleep
- External signal absorption (human, AI, world)
- Demonstrative test function

## Extending

- Integrate real-world APIs for external signals
- Extend phase logic for nuanced transitions
- Experiment with network size, topology, and connectivity
