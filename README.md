# Adaptive Neural Network

A biologically-inspired network of nodes (“AliveLoopNode”) interacting with capacitors and external data streams, featuring:
- Staged sleep (light, REM, deep)
- Mixed/overlapping phases (active, inspired, interactive)
- Anxiety and restorative behaviour
- Memory replay/sharing during sleep
- External signal adaptation

## Project Structure

- `core/` — Main model classes (`alive_node.py`, `capacitor.py`, `network.py`)
- `experiments/` — Testing and demonstration scripts (`demo_test.py`)
- `run_simulation.py` — Entry point for running the demo
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions

## Getting Started

1. Install requirements (`numpy`).
2. Run the demo simulation:
   ```bash
   python run_simulation.py
   ```

## Features

- Staged sleep (light, REM, deep)
- Mixed/overlapping phases (active, inspired, interactive)
- Anxiety tracking and relief
- Memory replay and sharing during sleep
- External signal absorption (human, AI, world)
- Demonstrative test function

## Extending

- Integrate real-world APIs for external signals
- Extend phase logic for nuanced transitions
- Experiment with network size, topology, and connectivity
