Cognitive Intelligence Testing - Adaptive Reasoning Tests

Test Category: Cognitive Intelligence - Adaptive Reasoning
Description: Tests the ability to adjust problem-solving strategies based on context
and environmental conditions.

Test Cases:
1. Context-dependent strategy switching
2. Dynamic problem-solving adaptation
3. Environmental condition response
4. Strategy effectiveness evaluation

Example usage:
    python -m unittest tests.cognitive_intelligence.test_adaptive_reasoning
