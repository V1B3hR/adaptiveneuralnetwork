# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of Adaptive Neural Network:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 0.1.0 | ❌ No              |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create a Public Issue

Please **do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This helps protect users until a fix can be deployed.

### 2. Report Privately

Send a detailed report to: **[security@adaptiveneuralnetwork.org]** (or create a private security advisory on GitHub)

Include in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt within 2 business days
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
- **Fix Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 14 days
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate responsible disclosure with you

### 4. Security Advisory Process

For confirmed vulnerabilities:
1. We will create a private security advisory
2. Develop and test a fix
3. Prepare a security release
4. Coordinate public disclosure
5. Credit the reporter (if desired)

## Security Considerations

### Data Handling

**Training Data:**
- The bitext training system can download datasets from Kaggle
- Ensure you have rights to use any datasets
- Be aware of data privacy implications
- Validate data sources and content

**Configuration Files:**
- Configuration files may contain sensitive parameters
- Do not commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive values
- Secure configuration file permissions

**Model Artifacts:**
- Trained models may encode sensitive information from training data
- Be cautious when sharing or deploying models
- Consider differential privacy for sensitive datasets

### Network Communications

**Kaggle Integration:**
- API keys are transmitted over HTTPS
- Credentials are stored locally in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
- Use secure file permissions (600) for credential files
- Rotate API keys periodically

**GitHub Actions:**
- Secrets are handled securely by GitHub Actions
- Never echo secrets in workflow logs
- Use minimal necessary permissions
- Regularly review workflow permissions

### Dependencies

**Supply Chain Security:**
- We pin major version dependencies to prevent unexpected updates
- Optional dependencies are clearly marked
- We regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Development dependencies are separate from runtime dependencies

**Optional Dependencies:**
- The `[nlp]` extra includes pandas, scikit-learn, kagglehub
- The `[jax]` extra includes JAX ecosystem packages
- Only install extras you need to minimize attack surface

### Code Execution

**Configuration System:**
- Configuration files use safe YAML/JSON parsing
- No arbitrary code execution in configuration
- Input validation and sanitization for all config values
- Safe defaults for all parameters

**Training Pipeline:**
- Text preprocessing uses safe transformations
- Model training uses established libraries (scikit-learn)
- Deterministic random seeds prevent non-deterministic behavior
- Memory limits and timeouts prevent resource exhaustion

### Adaptive Network Security

**Attack Resilience Features:**
- The system includes configurable attack resilience
- Energy drain resistance and signal redundancy
- Trust manipulation detection
- These are research features, not production security controls

**State Management:**
- Node state is managed through controlled interfaces
- Configuration changes are validated and logged
- Memory usage is bounded by configuration limits

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade adaptiveneuralnetwork
   ```

2. **Secure Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Use environment variables for secrets
   export KAGGLE_USERNAME=your_username
   export KAGGLE_KEY=your_api_key
   
   # Set secure file permissions
   chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```

3. **Validate Data Sources**
   ```python
   # Always validate external data
   loader = BitextDatasetLoader(dataset_name="verified/dataset")
   info = loader.get_dataset_info()
   print(f"Data source: {info}")
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   ```python
   # Always validate user inputs
   if not 0 <= config.energy_drain_resistance <= 1:
       raise ValueError("energy_drain_resistance must be 0-1")
   ```

2. **Safe Defaults**
   ```python
   # Use safe defaults for all parameters
   def __init__(self, max_memory_size: int = 1000):
       self.max_memory_size = min(max_memory_size, 10000)  # Cap at reasonable limit
   ```

3. **Logging Security**
   ```python
   # Never log sensitive information
   logger.info(f"Loading dataset: {dataset_name}")  # OK
   logger.info(f"API key: {api_key}")  # NEVER DO THIS
   ```

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Use virtual environments or containers
   - Run with minimal necessary privileges
   - Isolate training workloads from production systems

2. **Resource Limits**
   - Set memory and CPU limits for training processes
   - Use timeouts for long-running operations
   - Monitor resource usage

3. **Access Control**
   - Restrict access to configuration files
   - Use secure credential management
   - Audit access to trained models

## Known Security Considerations

### Pickle Files
- Model serialization uses Python's pickle format
- Only load models from trusted sources
- Consider alternative serialization formats for production

### Synthetic Data
- Synthetic data generation uses pseudorandom number generators
- Not cryptographically secure random
- Suitable for testing but not for security-sensitive applications

### Configuration Validation
- Configuration validation provides warnings but not strict enforcement
- Users can override safety limits
- Always validate configuration in production environments
