# Task Completion Summary: Run Smoke Tests for Quick Validation

## 🎯 Objective
Validate that smoke tests work correctly for quick validation of the Adaptive Neural Network system.

## ✅ Status: COMPLETE

All smoke tests are functional, documented, and production-ready.

---

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Validated Existing Smoke Test Infrastructure
- ✅ Tested existing smoke test implementation in `run_bitext_training.py`
- ✅ Verified all 7 test scenarios in `test_quickstart_features.py`
- ✅ Confirmed CLI interface works correctly
- ✅ Validated output file generation (JSON + PKL)

### 2. Created Easy-to-Use Runner Scripts
- ✅ **run_smoke_tests.py** - Python runner with flexible options
- ✅ **run_smoke_tests.sh** - Bash runner for CI/CD integration
- Both support CLI-only and suite-only modes

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- ✅ **SMOKE_TESTS.md** - Complete reference guide (4.7 KB)
- ✅ **SMOKE_TEST_VALIDATION.md** - Detailed validation report (6.5 KB)
- ✅ **SMOKE_TESTS_EXAMPLES.md** - Quick start examples (6.0 KB)

### 4. Verified All Test Scenarios
1. ✅ Smoke Test - Default Settings
2. ✅ Smoke Test - Custom Settings
3. ✅ Benchmark Mode - Full Evaluation
4. ✅ Local CSV File Support
5. ✅ Access Trained Models
6. ✅ Access Detailed Metrics
7. ✅ Configure Subset Sizes

## 🚀 How to Use

### Method 1: Python Runner (Recommended)
```bash
python run_smoke_tests.py
```

### Method 2: Bash Runner
```bash
./run_smoke_tests.sh
```

### Method 3: Direct CLI
```bash
python -m adaptiveneuralnetwork.training.scripts.run_bitext_training --mode smoke
```

### Method 4: Programmatic API
```python
from adaptiveneuralnetwork.training.scripts.run_bitext_training import run_smoke_test
results = run_smoke_test(subset_size=100, output_dir="outputs")
```
