# Adaptive Neural Network Roadmap (Fall 2025)

This roadmap outlines the next major development phases for the project, focusing on adaptive learning, robust generalization, and system intelligence growth. It is designed to leverage recent upgrades (attack resilience, proactive intervention, rolling history, benchmark/dataset integration) and push the system toward real-world intelligence and autonomy.

## Phase 1: Adaptive Learning & Continual Improvement

### 1.1. Self-Supervised & Online Learning
- Implement modules for self-supervised signal prediction and representation learning.
- Enable continual (lifelong) learning: update model weights with new data while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.
- Integrate curriculum learning: automatically adjust task difficulty based on agent performance.

### 1.2. Experience Replay & Memory Systems
- Add experience replay buffers for storing and sampling key events.
- Develop dynamic memory prioritization (e.g., importance-based sampling).
- Expand time-series analysis on rolling histories for event-driven learning.

### 1.3. Automated Benchmark Difficulty Scaling
- Dynamically adjust benchmark tests' complexity if intelligence scores plateau or reach 100.
- Implement adversarial and out-of-distribution test generators.
- Track and visualize learning curves and challenge responses.

## Phase 2: Generalization, Social, and Multi-Agent Intelligence

### 2.1. Cross-Domain Generalization
- Develop tests and training routines for transferring knowledge to new domains and tasks.
- Integrate synthetic data and randomization to force generalization.

### 2.2. Multi-Agent, Social Learning, & Consensus
- Create environments for multi-agent interaction (collaboration, competition, consensus).
- Implement agent communication protocols, trust scoring, and ambiguous signal handling.
- Add tests for consensus-building and conflict resolution.

### 2.3. Real-World Simulation & Transfer Learning
- Connect system to simulated sensors or real-world data streams.
- Validate model transfer/adaptation to new environments and scenarios.

## Phase 3: Explainability, Ethics, and Robustness

### 3.1. Explainable Decision Logging
- Log reasoning chains, ethical decision factors, and trust calculations for every major action.
- Develop visualization tools for audit trails and decision flows.

### 3.2. Ethics in Learning
- Monitor and enforce ethical compliance (25-law framework) during adaptive learning and agent interactions.
- Build benchmark scenarios specifically targeting ethical dilemmas, deception, and audit bypass attempts.

---

## Phase 4: Experiment Automation & Reproducibility

### 4.1. Automated Experiment Tracking
- Standardize experiment artifact storage (results, checkpoints, metrics) with time-stamped directories.
- Integrate reproducibility seeds, environment capture, and config logging.

### 4.2. CI/CD for Learning & Benchmarking
- Update workflows to trigger learning experiments and benchmarks on code changes or schedule.
- Publish benchmark and training metrics as status badges or dashboard.

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & Community

### 5.1. Documentation Expansion
- Update guides with new learning modules, experiment instructions, and benchmark results.
- Add reproducibility, troubleshooting, and ethics integration sections.

### 5.2. Community Collaboration
- Invite contributions for new learning scenarios, benchmarks, and adversarial challenges.
- Host periodic model comparison events.
