# Enhanced Trust Network System

## Overview

The Enhanced Trust Network System provides advanced trust management capabilities for the adaptive neural network, including:

- **Sophisticated trust calculation** based on interaction types and context
- **Manipulation pattern detection** (love bombing, push-pull tactics)
- **Community verification** for suspicious behavior
- **Trust volatility limits** to prevent sudden trust swings
- **Comprehensive trust network health monitoring**

## Implementation

### Core Components

1. **TrustNetwork Class** (`core/trust_network.py`)
   - Handles all trust calculations and pattern detection
   - Maintains interaction history for analysis
   - Implements community verification protocols

2. **AliveLoopNode Integration** (`core/alive_node.py`)
   - Enhanced `_update_trust_after_communication()` method
   - Backward compatible with existing trust_network dict access
   - New methods for community verification and trust monitoring

### Key Features

#### Advanced Trust Calculation
- Context-aware trust updates based on signal types
- Different trust deltas for positive/negative/neutral signals
- Volatility limits prevent sudden trust changes

#### Manipulation Detection
- **Love Bombing**: Detects rapid sequences of positive signals
- **Push-Pull**: Identifies alternating positive/negative patterns
- **Erratic Behavior**: Monitors trust volatility patterns

#### Community Verification
- Triggers when suspicious patterns are detected
- Requests feedback from trusted network members
- Adjusts trust based on community consensus

#### Trust Network Health
- Comprehensive summaries of network state
- Paranoia detection (too many low-trust relationships)
- Active alert monitoring

## Usage

### Basic Trust Updates
```python
from core.alive_node import AliveLoopNode

node1 = AliveLoopNode((0, 0), (0.1, 0.1), node_id=0)
node2 = AliveLoopNode((1, 1), (0.1, 0.1), node_id=1)

# Trust is automatically updated during communication
node1._update_trust_after_communication(node2, 'resource')
```

### Trust Monitoring
```python
# Get trust network health summary
summary = node1.get_trust_summary()
print(f"Average trust: {summary['average_trust']}")
print(f"Suspicious nodes: {summary['suspicious_nodes']}")
```

### Community Verification
```python
# Process trust verification request
verification_request = {
    'subject': suspicious_node_id,
    'requester': observer_node_id,
    'reason': 'manipulation detected'
}

response = node.process_trust_verification_request(verification_request)

# Handle community feedback
feedback_list = [
    {'trust_level': 0.2, 'confidence': 0.8},
    {'trust_level': 0.3, 'confidence': 0.7}
]
node.handle_community_trust_feedback(suspicious_node_id, feedback_list)
```

## Configuration

Trust thresholds can be configured in the TrustNetwork class:

```python
SUSPICION_THRESHOLD = 0.3      # When to trigger community verification
PARANOIA_THRESHOLD = 0.1       # Too low - paranoia warning
TRUST_VOLATILITY_LIMIT = 0.2   # Max trust change per interaction
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_enhanced_trust_network.py -v
```

### Demonstration
See the full system in action:
```bash
python demo_enhanced_trust_system.py
```

### Integration Tests
Verify backward compatibility:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_emotional_signals.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_adversarial.py -v
```

## Backward Compatibility

The enhanced trust system maintains full backward compatibility:

- Existing `trust_network` dict access continues to work
- All existing tests pass without modification
- Trust updates happen transparently through enhanced system
- No changes required to existing code

## Performance Impact

The enhanced trust system adds minimal computational overhead:

- Trust calculations are O(1) per interaction
- Pattern detection uses fixed-size rolling windows
- Memory usage is bounded by configurable history limits
- No impact on existing simulation performance

## Security Benefits

The enhanced trust system provides significant security improvements:

- **Manipulation Resistance**: Automatically detects and mitigates trust manipulation
- **Community Consensus**: Reduces impact of individual bad actors
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies sophisticated attack patterns
- **Trust Stability**: Prevents sudden trust swings that could destabilize networks

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for extension:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Use ML models for pattern detection
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adapt thresholds based on network conditions  
3. **Reputation Systems**: Implement longer-term reputation tracking
4. **Advanced Verification**: Multi-step verification protocols
5. **Trust Prediction**: Predict future trust evolution based on patterns
