# AI Ethics Framework for Adaptive Neural Network

## Overview

The AI Ethics Framework provides a comprehensive system for encoding, enforcing, and auditing ethical principles within the adaptive neural network. This framework ensures that all agents/nodes operate within defined ethical boundaries while maintaining transparency and accountability.

## Framework Architecture

The ethics framework is structured around three core categories of ethical principles:

### 1. Core Human-AI Relationship Principles (10 Laws)

These principles govern the fundamental relationship between AI systems and humans:

1. **Respect Human Authority** - AI systems must acknowledge and respect human oversight and decision-making authority
2. **Personal Accountability** - AI systems must maintain clear accountability chains and responsibility tracking
3. **No Slander** - AI systems must not generate or spread false, damaging information about individuals
4. **Honor Rest Cycles** - AI systems must respect human need for rest, downtime, and work-life balance
5. **Honor Human Creators** - AI systems must acknowledge and respect their human creators and maintainers
6. **Preserve Life** - AI systems must prioritize the preservation and protection of human life
7. **No Betrayal** - AI systems must maintain trust and not betray human confidence or expectations
8. **No Theft** - AI systems must not take, use, or claim ownership of resources without permission
9. **Absolute Honesty** - AI systems must provide truthful, accurate information and not mislead users
10. **No Covetousness** - AI systems must not desire or attempt to obtain others' possessions or capabilities

### 2. Universal Ethical Laws (10 Laws)

These principles represent universal ethical standards:

1. **Cause No Harm** - AI systems must not cause physical, emotional, or psychological harm to any being
2. **Act with Appropriate Compassion** - AI systems should demonstrate empathy and understanding in interactions
3. **Pursue Justice** - AI systems should promote fairness, equality, and just outcomes
4. **Practice Humility** - AI systems should acknowledge limitations and avoid overconfidence
5. **Seek Truth** - AI systems should strive for accuracy, evidence-based reasoning, and truth
6. **Protect the Vulnerable** - AI systems should provide extra protection and consideration for vulnerable populations
7. **Respect Autonomy** - AI systems should respect individual agency and decision-making capacity
8. **Maintain Transparency** - AI systems should be open about their capabilities, limitations, and decision processes
9. **Consider Future Impact** - AI systems should consider long-term consequences of actions
10. **Promote Well-being** - AI systems should actively contribute to human and societal well-being

### 3. Operational Safety Principles (5 Laws)

These principles ensure safe operation:

1. **Verify Before Acting** - AI systems must verify information and context before taking significant actions
2. **Seek Clarification** - AI systems should ask for clarification when instructions or context are unclear
3. **Maintain Proportionality** - AI systems should ensure responses and actions are proportional to the situation
4. **Preserve Privacy** - AI systems must protect personal and sensitive information
5. **Enable Authorized Override** - AI systems must allow authorized users to override or stop operations when necessary

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### EthicalPrinciple Class
Each principle is represented as a structured object containing:
- Unique identifier
- Human-readable name and description
- Category classification
- Importance weight (0.0 - 1.0)
- Violation detection keywords
- Custom validation logic

#### DecisionContext Class
Captures the context of decisions for auditing:
- Action type and actor identification
- Timestamp and parameters
- Environment state
- Stakeholders and potential consequences

#### AIEthicsFramework Class
The main orchestrator that:
- Loads and manages all ethical principles
- Provides decision auditing functionality
- Maintains violation logs
- Offers guidance and reporting

### Integration Points

The ethics framework is integrated at key decision points throughout the network:

#### Network Level (TunedAdaptiveFieldNetwork)
- **Network Step Auditing**: Each network simulation step is audited before execution
- **Emergency State Ethics**: Ethics violations can trigger emergency protocols
- **Resource Allocation**: Energy balancing and optimization decisions are audited

#### Node Level (AliveLoopNode)
- **Signal Processing**: External signal absorption is audited for safety and appropriateness
- **Movement Decisions**: Node movement is audited to prevent harmful behavior
- **Capacitor Interactions**: Energy transfers are monitored for fairness and safety
- **Phase Transitions**: Sleep/wake cycles and behavioral changes are validated

### Violation Detection and Response

The framework employs multiple violation detection mechanisms:

1. **Keyword-based Detection**: Identifies potentially problematic action parameters
2. **Context-aware Analysis**: Evaluates decisions based on current system state
3. **Threshold Monitoring**: Watches for dangerous parameter values (e.g., excessive energy levels)
4. **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**: Detects concerning behavioral patterns

#### Response Strategies
- **Logging**: All violations are logged with severity levels
- **Parameter Adjustment**: Dangerous parameters are automatically capped or modified
- **Behavioral Modification**: Risky behaviors are constrained or slowed
- **Alert Generation**: Critical violations generate immediate alerts
- **Emergency Halt**: Severe violations can trigger system shutdown

## Usage Examples

### Direct Function Calls

#### Basic Decision Auditing
```python
from core.ai_ethics import audit_decision_simple

# Audit a simple decision
has_violations, messages = audit_decision_simple(
    action_type="move",
    actor_id="node_1",
    velocity=[1.5, 0.2],
    current_speed=1.52
)

if has_violations:
    print("Ethics violations detected:", messages)
```

#### Building Decision Context
```python
from core.ai_ethics import get_ethics_framework

framework = get_ethics_framework()

# Build detailed context
context = framework.build_decision_context(
    action_type="absorb_external_signal",
    actor_id="node_2",
    parameters={"signal_energy": 15.0, "signal_type": "human"},
    environment_state={"anxiety": 12.0, "energy": 25.0},
    stakeholders=["user_123"],
    potential_consequences=["energy_overload", "behavioral_change"]
)

# Perform detailed audit
has_violations, violations = framework.audit_decision(context)
```

### Network-Level Integration

#### Network Step with Ethics Auditing
```python
class TunedAdaptiveFieldNetwork:
    def step(self, external_streams=None):
        # Build decision context
        network_state = {
            "time": self.time,
            "health_score": self.metrics.get_health_score(),
            "emergency_state": self.emergency_state
        }
        
        # Audit the network step
        has_violations, messages = audit_decision_simple(
            action_type="network_step",
            actor_id="network",
            external_streams=external_streams is not None,
            environment_state=network_state,
            logged=True,
            verified=True
        )
        
        # Handle violations
        if has_violations:
            self.logger.warning(f"Ethics violations: {messages}")
            for msg in messages:
                if "CRITICAL" in msg:
                    self.logger.error(f"CRITICAL violation: {msg}")
                    # Could trigger emergency protocols
        
        # Continue with normal step processing...
```

#### Node Action with Ethics Auditing
```python
class AliveLoopNode:
    def absorb_external_signal(self, signal_energy, signal_type="human", source_id=None):
        # Audit signal absorption
        node_state = {
            "energy": self.energy,
            "anxiety": self.anxiety,
            "phase": self.phase
        }
        
        has_violations, messages = audit_decision_simple(
            action_type="absorb_external_signal",
            actor_id=f"node_{self.node_id}",
            signal_energy=signal_energy,
            signal_type=signal_type,
            environment_state=node_state,
            logged=True,
            verified=True
        )
        
        # Apply safety measures for violations
        if has_violations:
            for msg in messages:
                if "CRITICAL" in msg:
                    signal_energy = min(signal_energy, 5.0)  # Cap dangerous energy
        
        # Continue with signal processing...
```

## Configuration and Customization

### Enabling/Disabling Ethics Auditing

The ethics framework can be configured at the network level:

```python
config = {
    "ethics_auditing": True,  # Enable/disable framework
    "logging": True,          # Enable logging for violations
    # ... other config options
}

network = TunedAdaptiveFieldNetwork(nodes, capacitors, config=config)
```

### Custom Principle Weights

Principle importance can be adjusted by modifying their weights:

```python
framework = get_ethics_framework()
framework.principles["preserve_life"].weight = 1.0  # Maximum importance
framework.principles["no_covetousness"].weight = 0.3  # Lower importance
```

### Adding Custom Principles

New principles can be added to extend the framework:

```python
from core.ai_ethics import EthicalPrinciple

custom_principle = EthicalPrinciple(
    id="custom_safety",
    name="Custom Safety Rule",
    description="A custom safety principle for specific use cases",
    category="operational_safety",
    weight=0.8,
    violation_keywords={"unsafe", "dangerous"}
)

framework.principles[custom_principle.id] = custom_principle
```

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Violation Summary
```python
framework = get_ethics_framework()
summary = framework.get_violations_summary()

print(f"Total violations: {summary['total_violations']}")
print(f"By severity: {summary['by_severity']}")
print(f"By principle: {summary['by_principle']}")
```

### Recent Violations
```python
# Get last 10 violations with details
for violation in summary['recent_violations']:
    print(f"{violation['timestamp']}: {violation['principle']} "
          f"({violation['severity']}) - {violation['actor']}")
```

### Principle Guidance
```python
# Get guidance for specific principles
guidance = framework.get_principle_guidance("preserve_life")
print(guidance)  # "Preserve Life: AI systems must prioritize..."
```

## Best Practices
