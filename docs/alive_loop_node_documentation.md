# **AliveLoopNode Class Documentation (Advanced Feature Set)**

## **Overview**

The `AliveLoopNode` class models a node in a dynamic, interactive, emotionally and socially adaptive environment. It supports modular energy and memory management, circadian rhythms, social learning, [...]

---

## **Core Features**

- **Energy Management**: Nodes consume, transfer, and predict energy. Distributed energy sharing and resilience against draining/jamming are supported.
- **Circadian & Phase Control**: Nodes follow 24-hour cycles with dynamic transitions between active, sleep (light/REM/deep), inspired, and interactive states, modulated by anxiety, calm, and social c[...]
- **Advanced Memory Systems**:
  - Multiple memory types: short-term (`working_memory`), long-term, collaborative, resource, reward, help, shared, and pattern-based.
  - Privacy controls: private/protected/classified memories, audit logs, retention limits, and importance weighting.
  - Collaborative memories allow for social knowledge integration and diversity tracking.
- **Social & Emotional Adaptation**:
  - Social learning using trust, influence, and emotional contagion (nodes affect each others’ mood).
  - Collective intelligence metrics: contribution and diversity.
  - Communication styles (directness, formality, expressiveness) adapt per phase and context.
  - Trust and influence networks determine interaction quality.
- **Communication**:
  - Signals include memory, query, warning, resource, anxiety help, and responses.
  - Rate limits, urgency, and energy costs per communication.
  - Communication queue and history for asynchronous processing.
- **Safety & Resilience Protocols**:
  - Attack detection and handling (redundancy, throttling, defensive state).
  - Energy sharing history and drain resistance.
  - Anxiety overwhelm safety protocol: help signals, cooldowns, calm management, and cooperative anxiety unloading.
- **Helper Methods**: Various utilities for suspicious event recording, help signal management, anxiety/calm updates, and collective interaction.

## **Main Methods**

### **Phase & Circadian Control**
```python
def step_phase(self, current_time: Optional[int] = None):
```
- Uses global time manager for simulation steps and circadian cycles.
- Dynamically transitions between phases (`active`, `sleep`, `inspired`, `interactive`) based on energy, anxiety, and time.
- Adjusts sleep stage per anxiety (light, REM, deep).
- Modifies communication style and resets help limits.
- Periodically cleans memory and manages anxiety/calm.

### **Movement**
```python
def move(self):
```
- Energy-efficient movement logic.
- Position update based on velocity and phase.
- Can be extended to move toward trusted nodes/social targets.

### **Memory Management**
```python
def _cleanup_memory(self):
    ...
```
- Periodically prunes memory by importance.
- Ages memories and removes if retention/importance limits are hit.

### **Social and Emotional Adaptation**
```python
def share_valuable_memory(self, nodes: List['AliveLoopNode']) -> List[SocialSignal]:
def apply_calm_effect(self):
def _apply_emotional_contagion(self, emotional_valence: float, source_id: int):
def _integrate_shared_knowledge(self, shared_memory: Memory):
```
- Shares most valuable memory with trusted, relevant nodes (with ethics check).
- Integrates shared social knowledge and emotional states.
- Tracks collective intelligence and knowledge diversity.

### **Communication**
```python
def send_signal(self, target_nodes, signal_type, content, urgency=0.5, requires_response=False):
def receive_signal(self, signal: SocialSignal) -> Optional[SocialSignal]:
def process_social_interactions(self):
```
- Supports asynchronous, rate-limited interaction with other nodes.
- Handles multiple signal types, including help and anxiety requests.

### **Safety & Help Protocols**
```python
def check_anxiety_overwhelm(self) -> bool:
def can_send_help_signal(self) -> bool:
def send_help_signal(self, nearby_nodes: List['AliveLoopNode']) -> List['AliveLoopNode']:
def _process_anxiety_help_signal(self, signal: SocialSignal) -> Optional[SocialSignal]:
def _process_anxiety_help_response(self, signal: SocialSignal):
def reset_help_signal_limits(self):
def get_anxiety_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
```
- Manages anxiety and help requests, cooldowns, and unloading.
- Tracks help requests, responses, and emotional/calm regulation.

### **Attack/Resilience**
```python
def record_suspicious_event(self, event):
def handle_attack_detection(self):
def share_energy(self, amount, recipient_id):
```
- Supports detection and response to suspicious/attack events.
- Manages redundancy and throttling for resilience.

## **Usage Examples**

### **Node Initialization**
```python
from core.alive_node import AliveLoopNode

node = AliveLoopNode(position=(0, 0), velocity=(1, 1), initial_energy=10.0)
```

### **Phase Simulation**
```python
for hour in range(24):
    node.step_phase(current_time=hour)
    node.move()
```

### **Memory Sharing**
```python
neighboring_nodes = [AliveLoopNode(position=(2, 2), velocity=(0, 0), node_id=2)]
node.share_valuable_memory(neighboring_nodes)
```

### **Help Signaling**
```python
if node.check_anxiety_overwhelm():
    helpers = node.send_help_signal(nearby_nodes)
```

### **Energy Prediction**
```python
node.predict_energy()
print(node.predicted_energy)
```

### **Attack Detection**
```python
node.record_suspicious_event("suspicious_activity_detected")
```

### **Social/Emotional Adaptation**
```python
node.apply_calm_effect()
node._apply_emotional_contagion(emotional_valence=0.7, source_id=2)
```
