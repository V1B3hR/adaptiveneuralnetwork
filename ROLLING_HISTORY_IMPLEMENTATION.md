# Rolling History Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement Addressed
"Rolling History: 20-entry calm, energy and rest of it keep history for trend analysis and proactive intervention"

## Solution Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive 20-entry rolling history system for calm, energy, and anxiety tracking with integrated trend analysis and proactive intervention capabilities.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Rolling History Storage (✅ Complete)
- **Anxiety History**: Already existed, maintained 20-entry deque
- **Calm History**: **NEW** - Added 20-entry deque for calm level tracking  
- **Energy History**: **NEW** - Added 20-entry deque for energy level tracking
- All histories automatically populated during node `step_phase()` calls
- FIFO (First-In-First-Out) behavior ensures exactly 20 most recent entries

### 2. Trend Analysis System (✅ Complete)
- **`analyze_trend()`** method performs comprehensive trend analysis:
  - Calculates trend direction (increasing/decreasing/stable)
  - Computes slope using linear regression
  - Measures volatility (standard deviation)
  - Provides recent average values
  - Configurable analysis window (default: 5 recent entries)

### 3. Proactive Intervention System (✅ Complete)
- **`detect_intervention_needs()`** identifies concerning patterns:
  - Anxiety trend analysis with threshold detection
  - Calm trend analysis with depletion monitoring  
  - Energy trend analysis with conservation triggers
  - Combined risk assessment for multi-system crises
  - Urgency level classification (low/medium/high)

- **`apply_proactive_intervention()`** executes responses:
  - **Anxiety Management**: Calm boost + anxiety reduction
  - **Calm Restoration**: Deep relaxation techniques simulation
  - **Energy Conservation**: Phase switching to preserve energy
  - **Comprehensive Support**: Multi-system intervention for severe cases

### 4. Integration & Automation (✅ Complete)
- Seamlessly integrated into existing `step_phase()` workflow
- Automatic intervention triggering when trends become concerning
- Real-time analysis after sufficient history accumulation (≥5 entries)
- Comprehensive status reporting via enhanced `get_anxiety_status()`

### 5. Comprehensive Testing (✅ Complete)
- **15 new tests** covering all rolling history functionality
- **6 existing tests** still passing (no regression)
- **Total: 21/21 tests passing**
- Coverage includes:
  - History initialization and population
  - Trend analysis accuracy
  - Intervention detection logic
  - Proactive intervention application
  - Integration with existing systems

### 6. Demonstration & Validation (✅ Complete)
- **Normal Operation Demo**: Shows stable trend tracking
- **Crisis Intervention Demo**: Demonstrates real-time intervention triggering
- **Visualizations**: Generated charts showing intervention effectiveness
- **Data Export**: JSON export capabilities for analysis

## Technical Implementation Details

### Code Changes
- **Modified**: `core/alive_node.py` 
  - Added `calm_history` and `energy_history` deques
  - Implemented trend analysis methods
  - Added proactive intervention system
  - Enhanced status reporting

- **Added**: `tests/test_rolling_history.py`
  - Comprehensive test suite (15 tests)
  - Covers all new functionality
  - Validates intervention logic

- **Added**: Demonstration scripts
  - `demo_rolling_history.py` - Basic functionality
  - `demo_proactive_interventions.py` - Crisis scenarios

### Key Thresholds & Logic
- **Anxiety Intervention**: Triggered when anxiety trend increasing with slope > 0.5
- **Calm Intervention**: Triggered when calm trend decreasing with slope < -0.3  
- **Energy Intervention**: Triggered when energy trend decreasing with slope < -0.5
- **Combined Risk**: All three conditions: anxiety_avg > 6.0, calm_avg < 2.0, energy_avg < 5.0
- **Rolling Window**: 20 entries maximum, analysis on last 5 entries by default

### Integration with Existing Systems
- **TimeSeriesTracker**: Already configured to track anxiety, calm, energy
- **Benchmark System**: Can leverage rolling history for performance analysis
- **Social Network**: Intervention needs can be communicated to other nodes
- **Memory System**: Intervention events stored as memories for learning

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Proactive Health Management**: System can detect and respond to concerning trends before they become crises
2. **Data-Driven Insights**: Comprehensive trend analysis provides actionable intelligence
3. **Automated Response**: Reduces need for manual intervention in crisis scenarios
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: All key metrics (anxiety, calm, energy) now have equal treatment
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend with additional metrics or intervention strategies

## Usage Examples

```python
# Basic usage - histories automatically populated
node = AliveLoopNode(position=(0,0), velocity=(0,0), initial_energy=10.0, node_id=1)
for t in range(25):
    node.step_phase(current_time=t)

# All histories now contain up to 20 entries
print(len(node.anxiety_history))  # Up to 20
print(len(node.calm_history))     # Up to 20  
print(len(node.energy_history))   # Up to 20

# Manual trend analysis
anxiety_trend = node.analyze_trend(node.anxiety_history)
print(f"Anxiety trend: {anxiety_trend['trend']}, slope: {anxiety_trend['slope']}")

# Check for intervention needs
intervention_analysis = node.detect_intervention_needs()
if intervention_analysis['interventions_needed']:
    print(f"Interventions needed: {intervention_analysis['interventions_needed']}")
    
# Get comprehensive status including history info
status = node.get_anxiety_status()
print(f"History lengths: {status['history_lengths']}")
```

## Conclusion
The implementation fully addresses the problem statement by providing robust 20-entry rolling history for calm and energy (in addition to existing anxiety), comprehensive trend analysis capabilities, and a sophisticated proactive intervention system. All features are well-tested, documented, and integrated seamlessly with the existing codebase.
