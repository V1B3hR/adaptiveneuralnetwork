  - **Status:** In Progress

- **Debugging, Profiling, Validation Tools:**  
  - Evidence: Profiling tools detailed in `docs/performance.md`; config validation in `core/alive_node.py`.  
  - **Status:** Completed

### 1.3 Validation Framework
- **Theoretical & Empirical Validation:**  
  - Evidence: README and roadmap.md claim published research, benchmarking suite; `docs/performance.md` describes validation protocols.  
  - **Status:** Completed

---

## Phase 2: Production Readiness

### 2.1 Scalability & Infrastructure
- **Distributed Training, Cloud Support:**  
  - Evidence: README and roadmap.md claim support, but direct code not visible in top 10 results.  
  - **Status:** In Progress

- **Containerization & Auto-Scaling:**  
  - Evidence: Mentioned in documentation, but Docker/K8s scripts not found in top 10 results.  
  - **Status:** In Progress

### 2.2 Production Features
- **Model Lifecycle, MLflow Integration, Monitoring:**  
  - Evidence: Not verifiable in top 10 results; claims present, but direct MLflow or monitoring code not found.  
  - **Status:** In Progress

- **Security & Compliance:**  
  - Evidence: `core/ai_ethics.py` provides an AI ethics framework, privacy controls in `core/alive_node.py`.  
  - **Status:** Completed (Ethics), In Progress (Full compliance/audit trails)

### 2.3 Backend Optimization
- **Neuromorphic Support, Quantization, Edge Deployment:**  
  - Evidence: README, roadmap.md, and dataclasses reference neuromorphic, edge features; specific hardware code (e.g., Loihi) not found in top 10.  
  - **Status:** In Progress

---

## Phase 3: Industry Applications

### 3.1 Vertical-Specific Solutions
- **Healthcare, Finance, Autonomous, Manufacturing:**  
  - Evidence: Not verifiable in top 10 results; described as goals in documentation.  
  - **Status:** Missing/Planned

### 3.2 Platform Development
- **Advanced Learning Paradigms:**  
  - Evidence: README and code (e.g. multimodal, NLP, phase dynamics) support completion.  
  - **Status:** Completed

- **Commercial Platform, Enterprise Integration:**  
  - Evidence: Not directly found in top 10 results.  
  - **Status:** Missing/Planned

---

## Phase 4: Ecosystem & Community

- **Open Source Ecosystem, Plugin Architecture, Education:**  
  - Evidence: README, roadmap.md, and docs mention these, but direct plugin code or education program files not found.  
  - **Status:** In Progress

---

## Phase 5: Status & Success Metrics

- **KPIs, Business Metrics, Research Impact:**  
  - Evidence: Stated in roadmap.md and README; not directly verifiable in codebase.  
  - **Status:** Declared/Planned
