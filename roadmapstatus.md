## Caveats and Recommendations

- **Comprehensive Audit Completed:** This updated audit reflects a thorough review of the repository structure, including production infrastructure, ecosystem modules, and demonstration files.
- **Industry Verticals:** While general-purpose applications exist (multimodal, IoT, continual learning), specific healthcare, finance, autonomous, and manufacturing vertical solutions are still in planning phase.
- **MLflow Integration:** While production monitoring infrastructure exists, specific MLflow integration is still in progress.
- **Compliance & Audit Trails:** Basic audit trail capabilities exist in the explainable AI module; comprehensive compliance and audit trail system is in development.
- **Next Steps:** Focus on industry-specific implementations, complete MLflow integration for comprehensive experiment tracking, and finalize compliance audit trail systems.
